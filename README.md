Basic Application with a frontend client interface and backend server
This application connects with API TMD
When you choose a movie genre and press play, the application retrieves a random movie with its short synthesis and poster.

This project was developed as part of my course of fullstack engineer on codecademy, the original just had a frontend and it was slightly different, I rebuilt it and create a backend.
